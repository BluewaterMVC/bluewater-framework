## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Fork and clone this repository.**
2. **Install PHP dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **(Optional) Set up for local technical docs preview:**

   * Make sure you have Python 3.x and `pip` installed.
   * Install MkDocs dependencies:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   * Or, for Windows users, run:

     ```
     preview-docs.bat
     ```
   * Or, use:

     ```bash
     mkdocs serve
     ```
   * This will serve the technical docs in `/technical/` at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Git Hooks Setup

To ensure code and documentation quality, Bluewater Framework uses **pre-commit hooks** for formatting, metadata insertion, and doc linting.

**How to set up Git hooks:**

* **Linux/macOS:**
  Run from your repo root:

  ```bash
  .githooks/setup-hooks.sh
  ```

* **Windows:**
  Double-click or run:

  ```
  .githooks\setup-hooks.bat
  ```

**What this does:**

* Installs and updates all Git hooks (including robust pre-commit checks).
* Ensures ‚ÄúLast Modified‚Äù tokens are up to date.
* Blocks commits with missing doc metadata or structure problems.
* Works across all major platforms.

If you update or add new hooks to `.githooks/`, re-run the above command/script.

---

*For details on the pre-commit policy and hooks, see [.githooks/README.md](.githooks/README.md) or the top of each script file.*

## üìù Technical Documentation

* **All technical documentation** for the framework lives in the `/technical/` directory.
* Preview, edit, and improve docs locally‚Äîsee above for setup.
* **Do not edit `/docs/` directly.**
  It is auto-generated in the publication process ([SYNC\_PROCESS.md](https://github.com/BluewaterMVC/bluewater-docs/blob/main/SYNC_PROCESS.md)).

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è Code Contributions

* Follow [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standards.
* Use strict types:

  ```php
  declare(strict_types=1);
  ```
* Document your code with PHPDoc, following the Bluewater PHPDoc standards.

## üåê Translating Documentation

- All new docs should be created in `/en/` (English) first.
- To add a translation, create a mirror file in the appropriate `/es/`, `/fr/`, etc. subfolder.
- Use the [Translation Request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/translation_request.md) for new or updated translations.
- Ensure the folder/file structure matches the English original.
- All translation PRs are reviewed for accuracy before merge.
- See [i18n Contribution Guide](docs/en/contribute/i18n.md) for tips and standards.

## ü§ù Pull Request Process

1. Branch from `main`.
2. Write clear commit messages and PR descriptions.
3. Include tests for new features or bugfixes.
4. Update or add technical docs in `/technical/` as needed.
5. Submit your pull request to `main`.

All PRs are subject to code review.

For details on how the Bluewater project is managed‚Äîincluding roles, decision-making, issue triage, and release process‚Äîsee our [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md).

## üîÄ Branching & Workflow

All contributions should follow the official branching process described in [WORKFLOW.md](./WORKFLOW.md):

- **Branch from `main`** for features, fixes, documentation, or refactoring.
- **Use descriptive branch names** (e.g. `feature/api-auth`, `bugfix/router`, `docs/quickstart-update`).
- **Push your branch** and open a Pull Request (PR) to `main`.
- **Choose the appropriate PR template** for your change (feature, bugfix, docs, etc.).
- All PRs are reviewed and must pass automated checks before merging.
- The `main` branch is always stable and deployable.

For the full, step-by-step workflow (with examples), see [WORKFLOW.md](./WORKFLOW.md).
