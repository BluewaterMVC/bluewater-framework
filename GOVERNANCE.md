# Bluewater Project Governance

This document defines the roles, decision-making processes, and operational standards for the Bluewater Framework and Documentation projects. Our governance ensures transparency, community input, and continuity as the project evolves.

---

## 1. Roles and Responsibilities

### **Maintainers**
- Review and merge Pull Requests (PRs)
- Manage releases and overall project direction
- Triage issues, assign labels, and oversee workflow
- Enforce the Code of Conduct and maintain a welcoming environment
- Select, mentor, and promote new maintainers as needed

### **Contributors**
- Submit issues and Pull Requests (PRs)
- Suggest improvements to code, documentation, or workflow
- Participate in technical discussions, reviews, and community support
- May be considered for elevated permissions based on merit and sustained involvement

### **Collaborators**
- May be granted limited write or triage permissions (e.g., issue management, documentation)
- Assist with triage, labeling, and issue closure under maintainer oversight
- Serve as a pathway for active contributors to gain trust and responsibility

## 2. Decision-Making Process

- **Consensus Seeking:**  
  Major changes are discussed openly in issues or PRs. Consensus is sought through discussion and community input.
- **Maintainer Oversight:**  
  Maintainers resolve disagreements if consensus is unclear, always considering the health of the project and input from active contributors.
- **Votes (if necessary):**  
  For significant or controversial changes, maintainers may call a formal vote after community input.
- **Conflict Resolution:**  
  In the case of persistent disagreement, the maintainersâ€™ decision is final. Appeals may be raised by opening a dedicated issue referencing this policy.

---

## 3. Succession & Inclusion

- New maintainers are nominated by existing maintainers and approved by consensus.
- Criteria for maintainership include sustained contribution, technical excellence, and adherence to the Code of Conduct.
- Inactive maintainers may be removed by consensus to ensure active stewardship.

---

## 4. Issue Triage & Labeling

For full triage workflow, see the [Issue Triage & Labeling section](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

- **New Issues:**  
  Labeled and triaged by maintainers/collaborators for clarity, priority, and type.
- **Labels:**  
  Standard labels include: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `question`, `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `blocked`, `security`, `refactor`, `translation`.
- **Assignment:**  
  Maintainers or contributors may volunteer for issues. Use `in progress` and remove `help wanted` as appropriate.
- **Security:**  
  Potential vulnerabilities are handled privately as described in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

---

## 5. Pull Requests & Code Review

- All code and documentation changes are submitted as Pull Requests (PRs).
- PRs must pass all automated checks and comply with contribution guidelines.
- At least one maintainer must approve a PR before it is merged.
- Substantial features or breaking changes require prior discussion and a design proposal (issue or discussion thread).

---

## 6. Releases

- **Authority:**  
  Releases are tagged from `main` by a maintainer after merged and tested features or bug fixes.
- Each release is documented in `CHANGELOG.md` and announced in project channels as appropriate.
- Hotfixes are tagged and described separately.

---

## 7. Code of Conduct

Participation in the Bluewater project requires agreement to abide by the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Violations are handled as described in that policy.

---

## 8. Changes to This Document

- This governance model may be amended by a Pull Request from any maintainer.
- All proposed changes will remain open for **at least 7 days** for community input, unless urgent.
- Final approval requires consensus of the maintainers.

---

## 9. Contact & Communication

- For general questions, use GitHub Issues.
- For private or security matters, see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
- Maintainers may list their contact info in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` or the project README.
