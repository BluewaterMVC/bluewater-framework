## 2. Decision-Making Process

- **Consensus Seeking:**  
  Major changes are discussed via issues or PRs until rough consensus is reached.
- **Maintainer Oversight:**  
  Maintainers make the final decision in cases of disagreement or if consensus is unclear.
- **Votes (if needed):**  
  For especially impactful or controversial changes, maintainers may hold a vote. Contributors are encouraged to provide input.

## 3. Issue Triage & Labeling

For full details, see the [Issue Triage & Labeling section](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

- **New Issues:**  
  Labeled and triaged by maintainers/collaborators for clarity, priority, and type.
- **Labeling:**  
  Core labels include: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `question`, `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `blocked`, `security`, `refactor`, `translation`.
- **Assignment:**  
  Maintainers or contributors may volunteer for issues. Use `in progress` and remove `help wanted` as needed.
- **Security:**  
  Potential vulnerabilities are handled privately and disclosed per [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

## 4. Pull Requests & Code Review

- All code and documentation changes should be submitted as Pull Requests.
- Each PR must pass automated checks, tests, and adhere to contribution guidelines.
