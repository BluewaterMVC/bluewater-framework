# 🌐 Internationalization (i18n) Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest in making Bluewater documentation accessible to users around the world!  
This guide explains how to contribute translations and help maintain our multi-language docs.

---

## 📄 What is i18n?

**Internationalization (i18n)** is the process of making content available in multiple languages.  
For Bluewater, all technical and user documentation can be translated to help developers and users everywhere.

---

## 📁 Documentation Structure

Translations are organized in language subfolders under `/docs/`:

```
/docs/
en/           # English (canonical source)
es/           # Spanish
fr/           # French
de/           # German
...
```

- Each language folder should mirror the English (`en/`) folder and file structure.
- For example, `/docs/en/getting-started.md` → `/docs/es/getting-started.md`

## ✍️ How to Contribute a Translation

1. **Pick a Page:**  
   Choose any file in `/docs/en/` that you want to translate.

2. **Fork the Repo:**  
   Fork [Bluewater Docs](https://github.com/BluewaterMVC/bluewater-docs), clone your fork locally.

3. **Create or Update the Language Folder:**  
   - If your language folder doesn’t exist (e.g., `/docs/it/` for Italian), create it.
   - Copy the original file from `/en/` into your new language folder, then translate the content.

4. **File Naming:**  
   - Keep the file names identical to the English originals.
   - Example: `/docs/fr/getting-started.md`

5. **Open a Pull Request:**  
   - Use the [Translation Request](../../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/translation_request.md) template.
   - Clearly state what file(s) you translated and your language.
   - If you are correcting or improving an existing translation, mention it.

6. **Review Process:**  
   - A reviewer (preferably fluent in the language) will check your contribution.
   - The file must follow the Bluewater doc structure and include the "Last updated: {{DATE}}" footer.

## 💡 Best Practices

- Stay true to the meaning of the original content—avoid direct machine translation when possible.
- Keep formatting, links, and code samples consistent with English docs.
- Don’t translate code examples, only surrounding explanatory text.
- If unsure about a term or phrase, leave a comment in your PR.

## 🌟 Recognition

All translators and i18n contributors will be listed in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) with their language(s).
