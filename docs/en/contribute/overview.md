# About Bluewater

## Overview

Bluewater is a visionary, open-source platform dedicated to setting new benchmarks in PHP application development and documentation. Designed for ambitious teams and organizations, Bluewater’s mission is to combine technical rigor with clarity, maintainability, and broad community participation. By decoupling architecture, documentation, and code, Bluewater ensures each aspect of your project receives specialized focus—while still supporting a seamless, unified developer and user experience.

## What Is Bluewater?

At its core, Bluewater is an ecosystem—a set of practices, standards, automation tools, and repositories that together create a strong foundation for building, documenting, and evolving PHP applications. Bluewater is not just a codebase or a documentation site: it is a framework for sustainable growth, robust governance, and multilingual accessibility.

### Why Bluewater?

- **Clarity and Transparency:**  
  Every architectural decision, coding convention, and documentation guideline is fully open and community-reviewed.
- **Rigorous Standards:**  
  Coding, documentation, and process standards are strictly enforced to eliminate ambiguity and technical debt.
- **Multi-Repository Structure:**  
  Bluewater maintains a clean separation of concerns.  
  - *bluewater-framework* holds all code and technical PHPDocs.
  - *bluewater-docs* houses architecture, workflow, and user-facing documentation.
- **Multi-Language from Day One:**  
  All user and contributor documentation is managed in a `/docs/{lang}` structure, with English (`en`) as the source of truth and automation ensuring consistent navigation and structure across all supported languages.
- **Automation-First Philosophy:**  
  Key tasks—from directory synchronization to standards enforcement and translation scaffolding—are automated for consistency, speed, and accuracy.

## How Bluewater Works

### Repository Roles

- **bluewater-framework:**  
  Contains the application source code, technical documentation (PHPDoc), and code-level assets.
- **bluewater-docs:**  
  Contains architecture diagrams, governance and workflow policies, contributor and user guides, and non-technical documentation.  

Both repositories are tightly coupled through automation and shared standards, ensuring seamless updates and synchronized versioning.

### Documentation & Standards

- **Source of Truth:**  
  All technical and user documentation is maintained in `/docs/en/`, and propagated to other languages via structured automation.
- **PHPDoc:**  
  Code-level documentation follows strict [PHPDoc standards](../../contribute/phpdoc.md) using provided templates.
- **Contribution Process:**  
  Clear onboarding and workflow guides—[CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md), [WORKFLOW.md](../../../WORKFLOW.md)—help new contributors integrate quickly.

## Multilingual by Design

- **Language Support:**  
  Bluewater’s docs are organized as `/docs/{lang}/`, where `{lang}` is an ISO language code (e.g., `en`, `fr`, `de`).
- **Sync & Placeholders:**  
  Adding a new language is as simple as adding an entry to a config file and running a sync script—scaffolding is automatic, and all docs maintain consistent navigation and structure.
- **Translation Guidance:**  
  Contributors can work in their preferred language; translation and placeholder conventions are clearly documented in [i18n.md](../../contribute/i18n.md).

---

## Community, Governance, and Collaboration

- **Open Governance:**  
  Decision-making, issue triage, and roadmap setting are open to community input, guided by [GOVERNANCE.md](../../../GOVERNANCE.md).
- **Inclusive Community:**  
  All contributors must adhere to our [Code of Conduct](../../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), ensuring a respectful and welcoming space.
- **Contribution Paths:**  
  Whether you’re an architect, developer, writer, translator, or reviewer, Bluewater’s process is designed to empower your contribution—see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for all routes to involvement.

## The Bluewater Difference

Bluewater is more than a documentation or code framework. It is a process and community for organizations that take software quality, clarity, and inclusivity seriously. With a transparent workflow, modern automation, and built-in multi-language support, Bluewater is the gold standard for sustainable PHP project development.
