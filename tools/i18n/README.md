# Bluewater Framework â€” Internationalization (i18n) Tools

This directory contains all automation and maintenance scripts related to internationalization (i18n) and translation management for the Bluewater Framework documentation project.

---

## Purpose

- **Ensure structural parity** between the canonical English documentation (`/docs/en/`) and all other supported language directories.
- **Accelerate the translation process** by programmatically creating missing directories and placeholder files for each target language.
- **Support quality control** by warning about extra, obsolete, or out-of-sync files in non-English directories.
- **Decouple configuration from code** for maximum maintainability.

---

## Language Configuration: `lang.yml`

- **Location:** `/tools/i18n/lang.yml`
- **Purpose:** Defines the canonical source language and all currently supported target languages for documentation.
- **Format:**
  ```yaml
  source: en
  targets:
    - es
    - fr
    - de
    - ru
````

* `source`: The root language (default: English, `en`)

* `targets`: List of all other language codes to be synchronized

* **To add or remove a language:**
  Simply edit `lang.yml`. There is no need to modify any script files.

---

## Scripts

### `sync_docs_structure.py`

* **Description:**
  Mirrors the directory and Markdown file structure of `/docs/en/` into each language directory listed in `lang.yml`, creating empty placeholder files with TODO comments if necessary.
* **Does not overwrite** existing translated files.
* **Warns about extra (obsolete or out-of-sync) files** present in target language directories but not in the source.

#### **Usage**

1. **Install required dependency (PyYAML):**

   ```bash
   pip install pyyaml
   ```

2. **Edit `/tools/i18n/lang.yml`** to set your desired languages.

3. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python sync_docs_structure.py
   ```

* The script must be run from within `/tools/i18n/`, or adjust the paths as needed.
* Review console output for actions taken and any warnings.

#### **Best Practices**

* **Run this script before every PR or release** that changes the documentation structure in `/docs/en/`.
* **Never edit the script to add/remove languages**; always update `lang.yml`.
* **Review warnings** for extra files to maintain directory cleanliness.

## Contributor Guidance

* **Translators:** Use the placeholders generated by this tool to guide translation work. Replace TODOs with actual translations.
* **Maintainers:** Periodically review all language directories and sync as needed to keep the project in parity and translation-ready.
* **Extending tools:** Place any future translation, navigation, or i18n-related automation in this directory for discoverability and version control.
