# 🌊 Bluewater Framework

**Bluewater Framework** is a lightweight, modular, high-performance PHP backend framework built for modern, multi-tenant SaaS API development.

- **Fast**: Designed for sub-10ms API responses and low overhead.
- **Modular**: Swap or extend any component—bring your own ORM, cache, auth, and more.
- **Secure**: Middleware-driven validation, JWT/OAuth2, and robust RBAC support.
- **Multi-Tenant**: Clean isolation for client data and configuration.
- **Framework-Agnostic**: Integrates with your favorite libraries.
